<h1>Proteoform Nomenclature Standard</h1>

This is intended as a community-based project sponsored by the [Consortium for Top Down Proteomics](http://www.topdownproteomics.org/), and all interested parties are encouraged to make suggestions.

This document defines rules for writing a fully characterized proteoform. The notation defined here must:
1. Provide an unambiguous way for writing an individual proteoform.
2. Be Human readable. Suitable for display in written document or presentation.
3. Be Machine parsable.
4. Contain the complete amino acid sequence of the observed proteoform
5. Specify the location and type of each modification.

A numbered version of the standard, along with a validator script is found [here](https://github.com/topdownproteomics/proteoform-nomenclature-standard/releases).

The work-in-progress version of the standard is [here](https://github.com/topdownproteomics/proteoform-nomenclature-standard/blob/master/Standard.md).
